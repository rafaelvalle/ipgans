In this paper we investigated numerical properties of samples produced 
with adversarial methods, specially Generative Adversarial Networks. We showed
that GAN samples have universal signatures that are dependent on the choice of
non-linearity on the last layer of the generator. In addition, we showed that
adversarial examples produced with the FSGM have properties that can be used to
identify an adversarial attack. Following, we showed that GAN samples smoothly
approximate the dominating modes of the distribution and that this information
can be used to identify the source of the data. Last, we showed that samples
generated with GANs violate specifications and do not provide guarantees on 
satisfaction of simple specifications. With this we hope to call attention to 
the necessity of the development of verified AI and better understanding of GAN
generated samples.
